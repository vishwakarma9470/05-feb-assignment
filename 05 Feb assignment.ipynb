    "the four pillars of object-oriented programming(oop) are:\n",
    "    1.Encapsulation:Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that manipulate the data into a single unit, which is the class. This makes it easier to manage the complexity of the program, and ensures that the data and methods are only accessed and modified in a controlled and consistent manner.\n",
    "    2. Inheritance:  Inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class is derived from an existing class, inheriting all the properties and methods of the parent class. This enables the creation of more specialized classes that inherit the common properties and methods from the parent class, and can add their own specific properties and methods.\n",
    "    3. Polymoriphism:  Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. This is achieved through inheritance and interface implementation, and allows for more flexibility and extensibility in the design of programs. It enables the creation of generic code that can work with a variety of different types of objects, without needing to know their specific type at compile time.\n",
    "    4. Abstractin: Abstraction refers to the process of focusing on the essential features of an object or system, while ignoring the irrelevant details. It enables the creation of models that capture the key characteristics of the object or system, and hides the implementation details from the user. This makes it easier to understand and work with the object or system.\n",
